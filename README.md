# HackTX_KV
From Simulation to Strategy â€” Real-Time Insights for the Fastest Decisions on Track.

This repo contains a full-stack prototype connecting a Monte Carlo strategy engine to a live dashboard. It explores pit windows, tire compounds, safety car effects, and fuel burn, then streams the top strategies to a web UI for race engineers.

See docs below for setup and run instructions.




# Instructions:

Run the `backend/src/api.py` file to start the backend.

Then go to `frontend/` and run `npm start` to load the frontend
